Exercise of modeling a board game for teaching purpouses.

The game simulates a board game, with multiple players over a circular path of tiles, won by the first player to complete a number of laps around the board.
- Movement is determinated by dice rolls

- Some tiles will make the player draw cards, which also have effects over the player/players

## Requirements for first iteration
- Support N sided dice
- Support M dices with varying sizes
- Game supports more than one player
- Number of laps per game can be configured
- Turn order must be enforced
